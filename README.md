# ai-commit

> No more headaches with commit messages.

AI-Commit is a command line tool that uses OpenAI's ChatGPT model to generate commit messages for your Git repositories. As a result, you can write meaningful commit messages without having to think about them.

## Prerequisites

To use AI-Commit, you need to obtain an API key from OpenAI and set it as the value of the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Sometime, the ChatGPT's response is not good (too long, too short, not meaningful). In that case, you can try custom the system prompt by set the `AI_COMMIT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` environment variable:

```
export AI_COMMIT_SYSTEM_PROMPT="You are a GitCommitGPT-4, You will help user to write commit message, commit message should be short (less than 100 chars), clean and meaningful. Only response the message."
```

By default, ai-commit use model `gpt-3.5-turbo`. You can change it by set the `AI_COMMIT_MODEL` environment variable:

```
export AI_COMMIT_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"
```

Note: Using AI-Commit will result in charges from OpenAI for API usage, so be sure to understand their pricing model before use.
